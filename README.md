# README Generator





  ## Description


The README generator creates a responsive prompt generator that allows the user to create a README through ease of access. The purpose of the project was to gain a better understanding of NPM, Inquirer and Node.js alike. The app is designed to generate a list of questions for required README fields. By separating each section with a table of contents, it allows the viewer to jump to each section in a streamlined manner. Base code was modified in order to deconstruct and better understand the process of creating functioning functions.
